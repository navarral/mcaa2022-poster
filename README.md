## Abstract
Publishing research data as open as possible can present a challenge for researchers studying the environmental factors related to rare diseases. Linking individual health events with environmental data through location and time together with the context from a person’s rare disease can present a data protection risk, even if data is pseudonymised. That is because effective anonymization methods cannot be applied without losing the value of the data for research with low sample sizes or specialized data, as in rare diseases.

The approach we recommend is to publish example health event-environmental linked data with its associated metadata, which could be shared as Open Data following the Findable Accessible Interoperability and Reusability ([FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)) guiding principles. Example data means simulated data which follows the same structure as the real data. Associated metadata includes data set descriptors (e.g. description, publisher and license), the original sources of data and the processing steps applied to the data together with the relevant data governance information (e.g. data controller, use, risks and processing purpose).

An example of a dataset with its associated metadata described using the Resource Description Framework ([RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/)), a standard graph data model, has been published in an open data repository following our proposed approach (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5544257). The dataset is an example result of associating air pollution and weather data subsets to particular health events within a region in the Republic of Ireland, together with the relevant metadata fields. The implementation of the FAIR guiding principles was applied on the necessary metadata and a Data Protection Impact Assessment, in accordance with the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/), was created, therefore ensuring good data protection practices were met to assess the necessary risks that could arise.

The approach proposed can support researchers in publishing data as open as possible when studying rare disease environmental risk factors. Furthermore, other types of studies linking personal data with scientific data could benefit from our approach as it provides enough research metadata so other researchers can reuse it in different contexts.
